Ready-to-use OnboardJS components built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Useful for new projects, MVPs, or when you need to get up and running quickly.

---

## Prerequisites

You need to have **shadcn and tailwindcss configured in your project**. If you haven't done this yet, please refer to the [shadcn installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) for installation instructions. If shadcn and tailwindcss are part of your project, you can initialize shadcn-ui by running:

```sh
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Usage

Find a component you like and copy the code snippets into your project.

For more information on how to use the components, refer to the [shadcn documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).
